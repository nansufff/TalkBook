 This project aims to revolutionize the process of converting written text into au
dio books by leveraging Machine Learning (ML) techniques.Unlike conventional methods
 such as the read-aloud feature of PDF viewers, our approach transcends mere text-to
speech conversion by integrating sophisticated emotion recognition and voice modulation
 algorithms.
 Key to our methodology is the incorporation of ML models trained to detect and
 interpret the emotional nuances embedded within the text. By analyzing factors such
 as tone, sentiment, and context, our web application dynamically adjusts the narratorâ€™s
 delivery to accurately convey the intended emotions, enriching the auditory experience
 for listeners.
 Furthermore, our system implements advanced voice modulation capabilities, allowing
 for seamless transitions between different characters and genders.
 In essence, this project represents a significant leap forward in the field of book-to
audiobook conversion. By harnessing the power of ML, our software empowers users to
 effortlessly produce high-quality audiobook versions of prose, stories, and books, distin
guished by their emotive depth and lifelike narration
